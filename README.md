The application enables the generation of QR codes based on the text entered by the user. QR code (Quick Response code) is a two-dimensional code that can store various types of information, such as URL addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and many more. This way, the user can share their information through the generated QR code, which can be scanned by another device with a camera and read with a suitable application.
